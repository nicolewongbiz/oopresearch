The switch statement in the `getWords` method has 14 cases, which indicates a high level of complexity. The overall pattern is classified as ""MIXED_LOGIC,"" and while it does not contain complex logic per se, the sheer number of cases (14) suggests that the switch is handling multiple responsibilities. This can lead to difficulties in maintenance and readability.

The analysis indicates that both `Quiz` and `LeaderboardData` classes share two methods (`setName` and `setScore`) without a common ancestor, suggesting a lack of proper inheritance.

Establishing a common superclass or interface for these methods would promote better code organization and adherence to OOP principles, such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

The switch statement in the `__configureData` method has 6 cases and a complexity score of 26.0, which indicates a moderate level of complexity. Given that the guidelines suggest that switches with complex logic are likely candidates for refactoring, and considering the recommendation to use polymorphism due to the number of cases, it would be beneficial to refactor this switch statement.

The switch statement in the `__addSubText` method exhibits complex logic and has a complexity score of 39.0, which indicates that it is not a simple mapping and involves more intricate decision-making. Given that it has object creation and is categorized as having mixed logic, this suggests that the switch statement could be a candidate for refactoring into polymorphism. By replacing the switch with polymorphic behavior, the code could become more maintainable, extensible, and easier","{

The switch statement in the `typeMacron` method of the `QuizController` class exhibits a complexity score of 15.0 with 5 cases, indicating that it is not a simple mapping and contains mixed logic. While it does not have complex logic in the traditional sense, the presence of multiple cases and the overall pattern being classified as ""MIXED_LOGIC"" suggests that the switch statement could benefit from refactoring.

The switch statement in the `setImage` method has 6 cases, which indicates a higher complexity that could lead to maintenance challenges. The overall pattern is classified as ""MIXED_LOGIC,"" and while there is no complex logic within the individual cases, the number of cases suggests that the switch could become unwieldy as more cases are added.
